# LinkedInBuddy
A Burp passive scanner extension which helpfully takes a note of any names and job titles you encounter whilst browsing LinkedIn

This is ultra basic at the moment and outputs the STDOUT only, so to set up you will want to go to the "Output" tab in Extender -> Extensions and select "Save to file".
